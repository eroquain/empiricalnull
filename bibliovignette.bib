	abstract = {The expression levels of \~{}4,600 cellular RNA transcripts were assessed in CD4+-T-cell lines at different times after infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 strain BRU (HIV-1BRU) using DNA microarrays. We found that several classes of genes were inhibited by HIV-1BRU infection, consistent with the G2 arrest of HIV-1-infected cells induced by Vpr. These included genes involved in cell division and transcription, a family of DEAD-box proteins (RNA helicases), and all genes involved in translation and splicing. However, the overall level of cell activation and signaling was increased in infected cells, consistent with strong virus production. These included a subgroup of transcription factors, including EGR1 and JUN, suggesting they play a specific role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Some regulatory changes were cell line specific; however, the majority, including enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, of changes were regulated in most infected cell lines. Compendium analysis comparing gene expression profiles of our HIV-1 infection experiments to those of cells exposed to heat shock, interferon, or influenza A virus indicated that HIV-1 infection largely induced specific changes rather than simply activating stress response or cytokine response pathways. Thus, microarray analysis confirmed several known HIV-1 host cell interactions and permitted identification of specific cellular pathways not previously implicated in HIV-1 infection. Continuing analyses are expected to suggest strategies for impacting HIV-1 replication in vivo by targeting these pathways.},

	abstract = {Although cancer classification has improved over the past 30 years, there has been no general approach for identifying new cancer classes (class discovery) or for assigning tumors to known classes (class prediction). Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},
